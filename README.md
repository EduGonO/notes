# edu notes

this is the source-code powering [a collection of notes](https://edunotes.vercel.app) that i've written over time, mostly for myself. in the spirit of [working with garage doors open](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu), i've published them and open sourced this website.

much of the code is forked from the work of people at [reflect](https://github.com/team-reflect/beginning-of-infinity) with some modifications of my own.

works under *writing* are original, my notes a mix of thoughts with quotes from the artwork subject of the note.
