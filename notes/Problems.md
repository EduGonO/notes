# Problems

Problems are inevitable because the search for [[Good Explanation]]s will create new problems and our [[Knowledge]] will always be incomplete.

Some problems are hard, but it is a mistake to confuse hard problems with problems that can't be solved.

All problems are soluble given the right knowledge, limited only by the laws of physics. 

Edison famously said that genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. But once a problem has been solved and a [[Technology]] created, the perspiration aspect is automated.
