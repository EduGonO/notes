	- collective auteurism + global audiences are giving rise to a new kind of media. not good nor bad but different
		- best example: tiktok

			- huge success
		- algorithms → popular culture (instead of cinema)
			- tiktok "entretainment"
			- personnalisation of entretainment
		- now?
			- trends in phones
			- New media, now characterized by GA and CA
			- universal technologies
			- "what happens to cinema once everyone has a phone and internet?"
			- It's not the end of cinema, but the evolution
				- traditional cinema will continue to ∃, but maybe not as the primary method of storytelling.
