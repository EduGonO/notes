      

Information which when physically embodied in a an environment tends to cause itself to remain so. E.g. through DNA replication, memes, writing, hard disks.

There are only two known sources of [[Knowledge]] creation. Evolution and our minds.

- [[Evolution]]
- [[Memes]]


      

We would normally regard a lunar colony, even after it has become self-sufficient, as having originated on Earth. But what, exactly, will have originated on Earth? In the long run, all its atoms have originated on the moon (or the asteroids). All the energy that it uses has originated in the sun. Only some proportion of its knowledge came from Earth, and, in the hypothetical case of a perfectly isolated colony, that would be a rapidly dwindling proportion.

      

The environments that could create an open-ended stream of knowledge, if suitably primedâ€“i.e. almost all environments.

      

Apart from the thoughts of people, the only process known to be capable of creating knowledge is biological evolution. The knowledge it creates (other than via people) is inherently bounded and parochial.

      

In the case of human knowledge, the variation is by conjecture, and the selection is by criticism and experiment. In the biosphere, the variation consists of mutations (random changes) in genes, and natural selection favours the variants that most improve the ability of their organisms to reproduce, thus causing those variant genes to spread through the population.

      

So, both human knowledge and biological adaptations are abstract replicators: forms of information which, once they are embodied in a suitable physical system, tend to remain so while most variants of them do not.

All knowledge is conjectural. It first comes from within and is intended to solve problems, not to summarize data.
