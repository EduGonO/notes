A universal system - capable of representing all states. Universal systems have been invented a few times throughout history but always by accident. Nobody realized their significance until decades, sometimes centuries later.


and there is no more reason to expect the brain to be a computer than a steam engine. But there is. A steam engine is not a universal simulator. But a computer is, so expecting it to be able to do whatever neurons can is not a metaphor: it is a known and proven property of the laws of physics as best we know them.
      

None universal systems:

-   Hieroglyphics 
-   Tally systems (tallying is universal only if digital)
-   Roman numerals 

  

Universal systems:

-   Indian numeric system (0-9)
-   Alphabet 
-   DNA (AGT)
-   Computers


      

ATGC is a universal system (dna). You can encode both bacteria and elephants using it.

      

As the rules of a writing system were improved, a significant threshold could be crossed: the system could become universal for that language–capable of representing every word in it.

      

And indeed it seems to be a recurring theme in the early history of many fields that universality, when it was achieved, was not the primary objective, if it was an objective at all.

At that moment the system was coding for nothing more complex than primitive, single-celled creatures. Yet virtually all subsequent organisms on Earth, to this day, have not only been based on DNA replicators but have used exactly the same alphabet of bases, grouped into three-base ‘words’, with only small variations in the meanings of those ‘words’.

      

for well over a billion years after the system had reached universality and stopped evolving, it was still only being used to make bacteria.
