# Universal System
A system that is capable of representing all states.

The first universal system we know of was DNA. We still don't understand its universal nature, but with it you can encode a chicken or a T-Rex.

Both brains and computers are universal systems. 

Examples of none-universal systems:
-   Hieroglyphics 
-   Tally systems (tallying is universal only if digital)
-   Roman numerals 
  
Examples of universal systems:
-   Indian numeric system (0-9)
-   Alphabet 
-   DNA (ATGC)
-   Computers (binary)
