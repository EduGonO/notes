# Optimism

The theory that all failures (all evils) are due to insufficient knowledge. 
This is the key to the rational philosophy of the unknowable.

Optimism would be futile if there were fundamental limitations to the creation of knowledge, but there are not. It would be futile if there were fields – especially philosophical fields such as morality – in which there were no such thing as objective progress. But truth does exist in all those fields, and progress towards it is made by seeking good explanations.

[[Problems]] are inevitable, because our knowledge will always be infinitely far from complete. Some problems are hard, but it is a mistake to confuse hard problems with problems unlikely to be solved. Problems are soluble, and each particular evil is a problem that can be solved. 

An optimistic civilization is open and not afraid to innovate, and is based on traditions of [[Criticism]]. Its institutions keep improving, and the most important knowledge that they embody is knowledge of how to detect and eliminate errors.
