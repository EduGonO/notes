# Bad Explanation

A bad explanation is unspecific. You can change any or all of the details without destroying it. 

Examples of bad explanations:

- Thunder is caused by Thor's anger
- Day and nights were created by God dividing the light on the first day of creation
- Summer is caused by [Persephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone)'s annual re-uniting with her mother Demeter.

In the above examples you could change any of the variables and the explantation would make sense.

- Thunder is caused by Zeus' anger
- Day and nights were created by God dividing the light on the last day of creation
- Hades is distracted when Persephone leaves, and forgets to cool the planet.
