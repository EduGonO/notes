#### numbers were the first writing system to exist.


first there was the same symbol for all numbers: IIIIIIIIII


- earliest improvements on numbers: **group** marks together

	( IIIIIIIIIIIIII  →  IIIII  IIIII  IIII )


- allowed people to go from **tallying** *(another, and another...)*
- to **counting** *(forty-one, forty-two...)*

#### a bigger improvement came along with the idea to have different symbols for different numbers. 


the best example for this new kind of writing systems were Roman Numerals. 

They added 7 symbols (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) and 3 main rules:

1. symbols must be ordered by decreasing value, from left to right.

	- VII+VIII  →  VIIVIII  →  VVIIIII


2. having symbols side-by-side is the same as adding them together.

	- VVIIIII  =  5+5+1+1+1+1+1


3. cannot repeat a symbol if it can be combined.
 
	- VVIIIII  →  (VV=X, IIIII=V)  →  XV


- these rules made roman numerals faster and more accurate for mathematics than tally mark symbols, which is why it stayed in use for ≈2400 years, from ≈-900 until the 1500s.

the biggest leap Roman Numerals made was allowing people to manipulate numbers and do math without needing to count individually. **their designs implicitly instructs people on how to do math.**


- however, the Roman Numerals still relied on **M** as as the symbol with the highest value (1000). 
- this meant that doing math on large numbers could only be done by carefully counting each instance of the same symbol (=counting tally marks), making simple operations much more difficult and error-prone.

	(**MMMMMMMMMMM**CDIII  +  **MMMMMMMMMMMM**CCDIII)

	- →  new system needed

#### ≈1500, hindu-arabic numerals


a writing system is universal if it can be used to write every single word in a language. most alphabets are able do this: no word exists that can be said but can't be written.


- Inspired by alphabets, hindu-arabic numerals were invented in IX Century India, but their potential was not immediately realized: it involves many non-obvious ideas if all you know are roman numerals.
- the system uses a set of 10 symbols (0-9) and only **one** single rule: the value of a digit depends on its position in the number.
	- 000**2**=**2**   00**2**0=**20**   0**2**00=**200**   **2**000=**2000**
- this allows the system to represent every number possible in an easy and understandable way.

this simple rule shows not only extraordinary design, but also deep mathematical insight.


- complex mathematical ideas (commutativity, associativity, distributivity) are rooted in the system itself thanks to profound design ideas (abstract representation, parsimony, spatiality).
- math and design (science and art) are entangled:   
mathematical insights=design insights.

this universality and leap in design is a consequence of deep **knowledge** about how **math**, numbers and **design** work.


- manipulation of numbers independently of tallying/counting and universality allowed arithmetics to be done more easily and accurately
- largest benefits: being useful for progress and unpredictable innovations.

	→  new ideas and applications of numbers such as prices, wages, taxes, interest rates soon followed.

that the most powerful tools for thought express deep insights into the underlying subject.


- each system of writing incorporates certain thoughts and knowledge about numbers: they each embody theories of which relationships of numbers are the most useful or interesting.
	- tallying → roman numerals: knowledge about addition, but only rules and properties about arbitrarily defined symbols.
	- roman numerals → hindu-arabic numerals: new knowledge about how math and about how numbers work, shows progress in science.

But many of the mathematical ideas and insights of hindu-arabic numerals were known to much earlier cultures like the Babylonians and Greeks (they led to inventions like the abacus). 


- the question, then, becomes: ::how does one make the leap to invent hindu-arabic numerals from roman numerals?::
