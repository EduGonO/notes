achieved a kind of cognitive escape velocity,

[[People]] are [[Universal Constructor]]s.

All observation is theory-laden.

[[Explanation]]s at any level of emergence can be fundamental. Abstract entities are real, and can play a role in causing physical phenomena.

[[Universal Computation]]: anything that can be written down as a program can be computed given the right memory and enough time.

## Why

- Why this book is so important
  - Easy to be nihilistic.
    - Universe is so large
    - Entropy
    - Humanity
  - But humans are [[People]] with infinite [[Reach]]
    - We can achieve anything within the laws of physics
  - The enemy is not technology / progress
- Progress is both possible and desirable
- There is no Shire
- Sustainability without progress is not a thing
- The culture of [[Conjecture]]/[[Criticism]] created during the [[Enlightenment]] puts us on the path to infinity. To control everything within the laws of physics.
- Free speech is the most important right
- Morality is objective
- Universal computation

[[Problems]] are inevitable. All problems can be solved with the right knowledge.

The humanity ending comet is already hurtling towards us. In every given century there is a one in a thousand chance earth would be struck with a comet that kills most of humanity.

Other threats: gamma rays, solar storm, supernova, sun exploding, nuclear weapons, stasis.

If a one-kilometre asteroid had approached the Earth on a collision course at any time in human history before the early twenty-first century, it would have killed at least a substantial proportion of all humans. In that respect, as in many others, we live in an era of unprecedented safety: the twenty-first century is the first ever moment when we have known how to defend ourselves from such impacts, which occur once every 250,000 years or so. This may sound too rare to care about, but it is random. A probability of one in 250,000 of such an impact in any given year means that a typical person on Earth would have a far larger chance of dying of an asteroid impact than in an aeroplane crash. And the next such object to strike us is already out there at this moment, speeding towards us with nothing to stop it except human knowledge.

## Political systems

The most important aspect is error correction, essentially being able to remove bad leaders.

## Knowledge

There are only two known sources of [[Knowledge]] creation. Evolution and our minds.

Memes are similar to genes in the way that they replicate.

- Conjecture
  - Rejection of authority
- Criticism
  - Fabillism (error correction)

Involves rejection of authority.

Good/bad [[Explanation]]:
An explanation that is hard/easy to vary while still accounting for what it purports to account for.

_The Enlightenment_ (The beginning of) a way of pursuing knowledge with a tradition of criticism and seeking good explanations instead of reliance on authority.

## Refuted modes

- Empiricism
- Ampromorphism

_Empiricism_ The misconception that we ‘derive’ all our knowledge from sensory experience.

_Inductivism_ The misconception that scientific theories are obtained by generalizing or extrapolating repeated experiences, and that the more often a theory is confirmed by observation the more likely it becomes.

_Induction_ The non-existent process of ‘obtaining’ referred to above. Principle of induction The idea that ‘the future will resemble the past’, combined with the misconception that this asserts anything about the future.

_Realism_ The idea that the physical world exists in reality, and that knowledge of it can exist too. _Relativism_ The misconception that statements cannot be objectively true or false, but can be judged only relative to some cultural or other arbitrary standard.

_Instrumentalism_ The misconception that science cannot describe reality, only predict outcomes of observations.

_Justificationism_ The misconception that knowledge can be genuine or reliable only if it is justified by some source or criterion.

Reductionism The misconception that science must or should always explain things by analysing them into components (and hence that higher-level explanations cannot be fundamental).

_Rule of thumb_ ‘Purely predictive theory’ (theory whose explanatory content is all background knowledge). Problem A problem exists when a conflict between ideas is experienced.

_Principle of Mediocrity_ - (anti-anthroprocentric)

The idea that there is nothing significant about humans (cosmically speaking) and anything claiming the opposite (e.g. sun revolves around the earth) is wrong. This theory is wrong because humans are knowledge creating [[People]] (thus have infinite potential).

## [[Reach]]

## People

- Universal explainers.
- Could be us, aliens, an AI. We all have this in common.

## Universal systems

## [[Spaceship Earth]]

- Fallacy. Earth was never friendly to us / had our priorities in mind. We would die without technology in oxford.
- Technology is automatic once created

## Spaceship spaceship

- Harvesting up hydrogen atoms to create a space station
