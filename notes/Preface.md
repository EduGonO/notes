### quotes i like

> «algún día recordaremos, recordaremos», se decía con la seguridad de que el origen de la fiesta, como todos los gestos del hombre, existía intacto en el tiempo y que bastaba un esfuerzo, un querer ver, para leer en el tiempo la historia del tiempo.

– elena garro, recuerdos del porvenir


> the reason you can't look at a photograph for a long time is because there's virtually no time in it—the imbalance between the two experiences the first and second lookings, is too extreme.

– david hockney, true to life


> steal all the clocks and watches

> in the world.

> Destroy them.

– yoko ono, clock piece


> in the end, stories are about one person saying to another: "this is the way it feels to me. can you understand what i'm saying? does it feel this way to you too?"

– kazuo ishiguro, nobel acceptance speech

writing keeps ideas in space

speech lets them travel in time

we use paintings to decorate space

and music to decorate time
 
⠀ ⠀ 
⠀ ⠀ 
 
As of today, no one knows how to translate paintings, flowers or music into language. Their beauty is implicit and exclusive to their form, which is why it's so hard to explain how a particular piece of art makes us feel.

find the way by moonlight

see the dawn before

the rest of the world
 
⠀ ⠀ 
⠀ ⠀ 
 
unconscious time, no peace of mind,

falling in space but still alive.

sketching the future in a single line,

everything's spinning, cannot sit down.

moments in space, places in time,

thoughts penciled in, now come to life.
