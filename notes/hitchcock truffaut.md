- truffaut pas styliste, il retiens la vitesse mais
- théoricien de l'espace, mathématicien
- acteurs comme details, hitchcock est le premier à mètre un structure au *langage* du cinema avec ces opinions sur acteurs

- rapport au control de hitchcock qui capturent une spiritualité
- birds shot from above, cleansing of earth, whose POV?

- inserts the wrong man
	- impossible to to the prayer scene if not from a catholic filmmaker

-
- vertigo
	- image reflect de hitchcok
	- yes its a fantasy mais its real for him
	- everything goes on
- interested in the audience, a film can be designed for 2000 not 1, greatest known mass medium in the world.
	- japanese audience should scream at the same time as the german audience.
	-
- climax every 2 seconds, visual hyperboles, overstimulation which gets in the way of thesis
- structure twisted to meet desired effect.
- by psycho, people are watching TV. we start to borrow from the real world.
- play the audience
	- where are you in a movie, hitchcock movie, universal movie. misdirection everywhere.
- scenes that indicate trouble are slowed, others are made faster
- bra, money, plot
- shower scene destroyed all rules
	- camera showing both her and behind.
	- it couldn't have happened but did. hitchcock proved his theory: people can't not watch
	- audience response and general work response. he knew it was ready for this kind of film.
	- for the first time it was dangerous to go to the movies
	- life is different now, and even the movies you'll see are different
- satisfaction of generating a mass emotion. not message or performance, nor a nove for an audiencel. it was pure film.
	- terrible subject, people were small, no characters. but the use of film in constricting this story caused audiences around the world to react and become immersed. pride is that the picture belongs to us, you and I.
- 1962 conversation started. they spoke and wrote, screened and confined on each other. 1966 publication, then truffaut made a movie a year. hitchcock made only 3 more
	- he was hunted by experimenting more with character and story. artist or entertainment?
- hitchcock closed his studio

- truffaut would die 4 years after hitchcock.
- TODO hitchcock l'artiste, qui écrit avec la camera
- you are interested, within your framework of storytelling, in filming moral dilemmas.
