⠀ ⠀  

this is a collection of notes that i've written over time, mostly for myself. in the spirit of [working with garage doors open](), i've published them and open sourced this website. much of the code is forked from the work of people at [reflect](https://github.com/team-reflect/beginning-of-infinity) with some of my own. 
works under *writing* are original, my notes a mix of thoughts with quotes from the artwork subject of the note.

### quotes i like

*"the limits of my language are the limits of my world."*

- ludwig wittgenstein
 
⠀ ⠀ 

*«algún día recordaremos, recordaremos», se decía con la seguridad de que el origen de la fiesta, como todos los gestos del hombre, existía intacto en el tiempo y que bastaba un esfuerzo, un querer ver, para leer en el tiempo la historia del tiempo.*

- elena garro, [[recuerdos del porvenir]]
 
⠀ ⠀ 

*"the reason you can't look at a photograph for a long time is because there's virtually no time in it—the imbalance between the two experiences the first and second lookings, is too extreme."*
- david hockney, true to life
 
⠀ ⠀ 

*"all of us believed fanatically that an airplane that looked beautiful would fly the same way."*
- ben rich, skunk works
 
⠀ ⠀ 

*we look at the world once, in childhood.*  

*the rest is memory.*
- louise glück, *nosotros, meadowlands*
 
⠀ ⠀ 

*"my pencil and I are more clever than I."*
- albert einstein
 
⠀ ⠀ 

*"high-level sciences enable us to understand emergent phenomena, of which the most important are, life, thought and computation."*
- david deutsch
 
⠀ ⠀ 

*steal all the clocks and watches*  

*in the world.*  

*destroy them.*  

- yoko ono, clock piece
 
⠀ ⠀ 

*"in the end, stories are about one person saying to another: this is the way it feels to me. can you understand what i'm saying? does it feel this way to you too?"*  
- kazuo ishiguro, nobel acceptance speech

writing keeps ideas in space  

speech lets them travel in time  

we use paintings to decorate space  

and music to decorate time
 
⠀ ⠀ 
⠀ ⠀ 
 
As of today, no one knows how to translate paintings, flowers or music into language. Their beauty is implicit and exclusive to their form, which is why it's so hard to explain how a particular piece of art makes us feel.
 
⠀ ⠀ 
⠀ ⠀ 
 
find the way by moonlight  

see the dawn before  

the rest of the world
