# notes

some notes i've taken on different topics over the years
these are some notes I've written on different topics over time. they're mostly for myself, but in the spirit of working with garage doors open, i've published them and open sourced this website. much of the code is forked from the work of people at reflect but I've also added some. 
works under writing are of my own, my notes a mix of thoughts with quotes from the artwork subject of the note.

original site notes:

We believe the [Beginning of Infinity](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359) to be one of the most important books ever written. However, it's quite dense and can be a tough read for the layman. We created this website in order to share our high level notes, spread David's ideas, and encourage more people to read his book.

We obviously don't take any credit for the ideas written here - they're directly taken from David's book or interviews with him. In fact we don't even take credit for this website's UX, it was inspired by [Andy Matuschak's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes). Thank you David and Andy!

We have open-sourced the [code behind this site](https://github.com/team-reflect/beginning-of-infinity) so you can use it for your own notes.

Created by the team behind [Reflect](https://reflect.app), the networked note-taking app.

We have made virtually no [[Progress]] over the vast majority of human history. Only recently (mostly since the European [[Enlightenment]]) has progress been discernible inside a human lifetime.

The [[Enlightenment]] showed us progress is both achievable and desirable. It instituted a culture of [[Conjecture]] and [[Criticism]], the two key components for any kind of rapid progress across any discipline from [[Science]] to [[Morality]].

[[Science]] is the practice of finding [[Good Explanation]]s, statements about what is there, what it does, and how and why. [[Morality]] is about the problem of what to do next and, more generally, what sort of life to lead, and what sort of world to want. Both disciplines are explanatory, rational, and objective.

There are many misconceptions about where scientific theories are derived from. A popular one is [[Empiricism]], that we derive theories from our senses. Another is [[Inductivism]], that the future will resemble the past. [[Testability]] is also generally accepted as a defining characteristic of the scientific method. All of these are wrong - there are many examples of valid theories that violate them. In reality, theories are a form of knowledge and thus born from [[Conjecture]] and honed through [[Criticism]]. Not all theories can be tested. Instead, they can only be evaluated by whether or not they're [[Good Explanation]]s.

[[Good Explanation]]s objectively differ from [[Bad Explanation]]s because they are [[Hard to vary]]. Explanations are inherently error prone (see [[Fallibilism]]) which is why we need [[Criticism]] and [[Error Correction]]. Explanations can have unbounded [[Reach]] (i.e. apply to solve unforeseen problems).

All [[Problems]] can be solved with the right explanations limited only by the laws of nature. However the search for [[Explanation]]s will create new problems. Hence problems are inevitable.

Once those explanations are recorded somewhere they become [[Knowledge]]. For billions of years [[Knowledge Creation]] was limited to our biological [[Evolution]], slow and random changes over time inscribed in our DNA. Then 7,000 years ago we invented language, 5,000 years ago writing, 582 years ago printing-presses, and very recently computers and hard-drives. Each stage has been a step change in the rate of knowledge creation, especially the jump from biological evolution to the thoughts of [[People]].

[[Explanation]]s are a form of information, and information can only be processed in basically one way, with [[Universal Computation]] of the kind invented by Babbage and Turing.

A [[Universal System]] is one capable of representing all states. Our DNA was the first known universal system. With a combination of ATG and C you can encode a chicken or a T-Rex. Jumps from non-universal to universal systems are the milestones on the road of human progress. For example moving from hieroglyphics to the alphabet, or from tally systems to the Indian numeral system. In each case we upgraded from an inefficient and unscalable system, where each step was customized, to an efficient scalable universal system, leapfrogging human progress.

Universal Systems have [[Reach]], unintended potential. For example the computer in your washing machine could, given enough memory and time, do astrophysics calculations. Oddly most jumps to [[Universality]] have been accidents. Only since the [[Enlightenment]] has their significance been understood and sought after.

Both the [[Principle of Mediocrity]] (we are nothing special in this universe) and [[Spaceship Earth]] (Earth provides the ideal environment for us) are mistaken. Earth no more provides us with a life-support system than it supplies us with radio telescopes. And [[People]], as [[Universal Explainers]], can have a cosmically sized impact upon the universe.

[[Knowledge]] creating entities (aka [[People]]) can exist almost anywhere in the universe. With the right knowledge [[People]] could feasibly create an ideally suited environment in an empty area of space by hoovering up and transmuting hydrogen atoms into a space-station.

[[Technology]], once created, is automatic. We will not have to think about vacuums or the complexities around surviving in space (the same way you don't think about your house's insulation).

Biological [[Evolution]] was a precursor to the main story of evolution, the unbounded evolution of [[Memes]]: ideas that cause themselves to replicate (aka [[Replicators]]). In many ways memes are analogous to genes, but there are also profound differences in the way they evolve.

Think of [[Memes]] as any ideas that are passed between lots of people. For example, a language, scientific theory, or religious belief are all memes. Memes have to be actively replicated to survive (i.e. spoken or written and distributed). A [[Rational Meme]] is a [[Good Explanation]] that relies on the recipient's critical faculties to cause itself to be replicated. An [[Anti-rational Meme]] is a [[Bad Explanation]] and invariably relies on hijacking base emotions for replication (tapping into fear or anger). A collection of [[Memes]] forms a [[Culture]].

Deustsch defines [[Optimism]] as the theory that all failures are due to lack of [[Knowledge]]. That doesn't mean proceeding as if there won't be bad outcomes (since problems are inevitable) - he calls that [[Blind Optimism]]. In contrast [[Blind Pessimism]] is avoiding everything not known to be safe.

[[Dynamic Societies]] tend towards [[Optimism]] and [[Rational Meme]]s. Because they embody the principles of the [[Enlightenment]] they make rapid progress. [[Static Societies]] fear change, are dominated by [[Anti-rational Meme]]s, and stifle [[Conjecture]] and [[Criticism]].

There are no mathematically provably fair forms of [[Governing]] and therefore the most important aspect to get right is to be able to remove leaders (see [[Criticism]] and [[Error Correction]]) when necessary.

Humanity was never sustainable. It is a myth that there ever was a time of tranquility where we lived peacefully at one with nature and each other. Existence was absolutely brutal until very recently. And eventually, unless we choose otherwise, we will be wiped out by an extinction event. Only by creating the right [[Knowledge]] can we be saved.

We should not use (the semblance of) [[Sustainability]] as an aspiration or a constraint on planning. For example, we shouldn't just try and solve the 'human' part of global warming. If the earth goes into a new ice-age, or warms dangerously, we should solve that regardless of how much of the problem is man-made or not.

Since all problems can be solved with the right [[Knowledge]] and we humans, as [[Universal Explainers]], have the potential to obtain any knowledge, we can have a cosmically sized impact upon the universe. Not only can we survive, but we can explore, learn, and thrive throughout our galaxy and more. If we so choose.
