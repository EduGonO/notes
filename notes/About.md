We believe the [Beginning of Infinity](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359) to be one of the most important books ever written. However, it's quite dense and can be a tough read for the layman. We created this website in order to share our high level notes, spread David's ideas, and encourage more people to read his book.

We obviously don't take any credit for the ideas written here - they're directly taken from David's book or interviews with him. In fact we don't even take credit for this website's UX, it was inspired by [Andy Matuschak's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes). Thank you David and Andy!

We have open-sourced the [code behind this site](https://github.com/team-reflect/beginning-of-infinity) so you can use it for your own notes.

Created by the team behind [Reflect](https://reflect.app), the networked note-taking app.
