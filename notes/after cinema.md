### outline

AI images have quickly evolved to a point of near-perfect photorealism and some have already gone viral worldwide. 

text-to-image models are not creative but derivative. they use data, elements and styles from countless artworks, sometimes without the author's consent, to create new and original results.
- this mechanism is largely responsible for negative reactions + debates around copyright, misinformation and ethical implications of artificial intelligence in the creative process.
- record labels are hostile towards AI but they'll embrace it as soon as they profit from it. maybe dead artists + current artists, Bad Bunny + The Beatles?

text-to-image generation is still in its infancy (!) but text-to-video models are imminent. *this* will challenge Cinema like photography did to art.
- current models already show impressive understanding of cinematic language.
- not long until anyone is able to create photorealistic movies using natural language. 
	- users specify cameras, lenses and framings, AI models create photorealistic sets, props, actors and dialogue.
	- no need for physical locations, crews or large budgets → cost of making movies will be significantly decline.
- democratization of the hollywood film studio →  new voices previously limited by costs of filmmaking.

it seems this new era of media creation is hostile to artists, but its not the first time technology has disrupted art. an example is the rise of photography in the 1850s.
- could capture reality instantly and with perfect accuracy.
- enabled mass reproduction of artworks that allowed multitudes of people to see them, but also degraded their individual impact (∴ influence)
- privacy concerns: taking photos of others without their consent
- copyright concerns: who owns the photo? photographer or photographed?

until then, painters were judged by their ability to accurately represent reality. they felt threatened since anyone with a camera could now do their job. but as photography became accepted as a new form of art, it suddenly helped to take away all these expectations. artists could now explore ideas without worrying about visual accuracy.
- painting had its biggest revolution, visually and philosophically → impressionism (1860s-1880s), cubism (1910s), surrealism (1920s-1930s), abstract art (1910s-now)

text-to-image generation is still in its infancy (!) but text-to-video models are imminent. *this* will challenge Cinema like photography did to art.
- current models already show impressive understanding of cinematic language.
- not long until anyone is able to create photorealistic movies using natural language. 
	- users specify cameras, lenses and framings, AI models create photorealistic sets, props, actors and dialogue.

as of today, no one knows how to translate paintings, flowers or music into language. their beauty is implicit and exclusive to their form, which is why it's so hard to explain how a particular piece of art makes us feel.

a new epoch of Cinema will arrive: anyone will be able to make a movie using natural language ∴ film and text will become the same thing. 
- every frame will be generated, not filmed.
- anyone will be able to read, write or watch a movie.
- cinema will detach from the camera.

this won’t be better or worse, just different.
