### outline

AI images have quickly evolved to a point of near-perfect photorealism and some have already gone viral worldwide. 

text-to-image models are not creative but derivative. they use data, elements and styles from countless artworks, sometimes without the author's consent, to create new and original results.
- this mechanism is largely responsible for negative reactions + debates around copyright, misinformation and ethical implications of artificial intelligence in the creative process.
- record labels are hostile towards AI but they'll embrace it as soon as they profit from it. maybe dead artists + current artists, Bad Bunny + The Beatles?

text-to-image generation is still in its infancy (!) but text-to-video models are imminent. *this* will challenge Cinema like photography did to art.
- current models already show impressive understanding of cinematic language.
- not long until anyone is able to create photorealistic movies using natural language. 
	- users specify cameras, lenses and framings, AI models create photorealistic sets, props, actors and dialogue.
	- no need for physical locations, crews or large budgets → cost of making movies will be significantly decline.
- democratization of the hollywood film studio →  new voices previously limited by costs of filmmaking.


as of today, no one knows how to translate paintings, flowers or music into language. their beauty is implicit and exclusive to their form, which is why it's so hard to explain how a particular piece of art makes us feel.

a new epoch of Cinema will arrive: anyone will be able to make a movie using natural language ∴ film and text will become the same thing. 
- every frame will be generated, not filmed.
- anyone will be able to read, write or watch a movie.
- cinema will detach from the camera.

this won’t be better or worse, just different.
