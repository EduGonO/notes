# people aren't meant to talk this much

- Your social life has a biological limit: **150** (number proposed by Robin Dunbar) people with whom you can have meaningful relationships.
    - We can reasonably expect to develop up to 150 productive bonds, but we have our most intimate, and therefore most connected, relationships with only about five to **15** closest friends. We can maintain much larger networks, but only by compromising the quality or sincerity of those connections; most people operate in much smaller social circles.
- Online media gives the everyperson access to channels of communication previously reserved for Big Business. Starting with the world wide web in the 1990s and continuing into user-generated content of the aughts and social media of the 2010s, **control over public discourse has moved from media organizations, governments, and corporations to average citizens.**

- The capacity to reach an audience some of the time became contorted into the right to reach every audience all of the time.
- First, **the platforms invented metrics to encourage engagement**, such as like and share counts. Popularity and reach, of obvious value to the platforms, **became social values too.**
- To constrain the frequency of speech, the size or composition of an audience, the spread of any single speech act, or the life span of such posts is ::entirely accordant with the creative and technical underpinning of computational media.::
    - companies have long embraced constraints. Tweets can be 280 characters and no more. YouTube videos for most users cannot exceed 15 minutes--before 2010, the limit was 10.
    - Later, Vine pushed brevity to its logical extreme, limiting videos to six seconds in length. Snapchat bet its success on ephemerality, with posts that vanish after a brief period rather than persist forever.
    - On LinkedIn, your profile stops counting after 500 contacts, which purportedly nudges users to focus on the quality and use of their contacts rather than their number.
    - It should be shocking that you pay no mind to recomposing an idea so it fits in 280 characters, but that you'd never accept that the resulting message might be limited to 280 readers or 280 minutes. And yet, **nothing about the latter is fundamentally different from the former.**
- Technology companies would surely fight any effort to reduce growth or engagement. Private citizens would bristle at new and unfamiliar limitations. But the alternative, living amid the ever-rising waste spewed by megascale, is unsustainable.
