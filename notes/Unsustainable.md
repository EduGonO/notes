# Unsustainable

A practice or lifestyle that cannot able to be maintained at the current rate or level. Often used in an environmental context: e.g. human population growth is not sustainable.

In practice, nothing is sustainable. Problems are inevitable and eventually one big enough will come along to prevent you from sustaining an existing course of action.

For example, it doesn't matter how 'green' the dinosaurs were, that they didn't burn fossil fuels, or massively grow their population. Eventually an astroid wiped them out because they didn't create sufficient technology to prevent it happening.

[[Static Societies]], such as the inhabitants of Easter Island, eventually fail not because they use up all their resources, but because they fail to create the [[Knowledge]] to solve their problems and save themselves.

In other words, the only way to keep riding this wave of unsustainability is by producing more [[Knowledge]] to solve our problems.
