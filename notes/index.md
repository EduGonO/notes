title: The Beginning of Infinity
---

The [[Beginning of Infinity]] contains a hopeful message for humanity. Author [[David Deutsch]] describes the processes through which our species has emerged from a dirt-scratching purgatory to today's towering technological heights, raising skyscrapers from that same dirt, and how we are but at the start of a road to infinity.

If we choose, no problem is beyond us. With the right [[Knowledge]] we can have a cosmically-sized impact upon our universe. We are limited solely by the laws of nature.

We have made virtually no [[Progress]] over the vast majority of human history. Only recently (mostly since the European [[Enlightenment]]) has progress been discernible inside a human lifetime.

The [[Enlightenment]] showed us progress is both achievable and desirable. It instituted a culture of [[Conjecture]] and [[Criticism]], the two key components for any kind of rapid progress across any discipline from [[Science]] to [[Morality]].

[[Science]] is the practice of finding good [[Explanation]]s, statements about what is there, what it does, and how and why. [[Morality]] is about the problem of what to do next and, more generally, what sort of life to lead, and what sort of world to want. Both are explanatory, rational, and objective.

[[Good Explanation]]s objectively differ from [[Bad Explanation]]s. TODO hard to vary. Explanations are inheritently error prone (see [[Fallibilism]]) which is why we need [[Criticism]] and [[Error Correction]]. Explanations can have unbounded [[Reach]] (i.e. apply to solve unforeseen problems).

Once those explanations are recorded somewhere, (such as on papyrus scrolls, DNA strands, hard-disks) they become [[Knowledge]]. There are only two known processes of creating [[Knowledge]]: thoughts of [[People]] and biological [[Evolution]]. They have some key differences (e.g. speed of replication, iteration, and progress).

[[Explanation]]s are a form of information, and information can only be processed in basically one way, with [[Universal Computation]] of the kind invented by Babbage and Turing. TODO - need to explain why this is true ie: can only be

All [[Problems]] can be solved with the right [[Explanation]]s limited only by the laws of nature. However the search for [[Explanation]]s will create new problems. Hence problems are inevitable.

Both the [[Principle of Mediocrity]] (we are nothing special in this universe) and [[Spaceship Earth]] (Earth provides the ideal environment for us) are mistaken. Earth no more provides us with a life-support system than it supplies us with radio telescopes. And [[People]], as [[Universal Explainers]], can have a cosmically sized impact upon the universe.

[[Knowledge]] creating entities (aka [[People]]) can exist almost anywhere in the universe. With the right knowledge [[People]] could feasible create an ideally suited environment in an empty area of space (by hoovering up and transmuting hydrogen atoms into a space-station).

[[Technology]], once created, is automatic. Once the technology exists we will not have to think about about vacuums or surviving in space (the same way you don't think about your house's insulation).

Biological [[Evolution]] was a precursor to the main story of evolution, the unbounded evolution of [[Memes]]: ideas that cause themselves to replicate (aka [[Replicators]]). In many ways memes are analogous to genes, but there are also profound differences in the way they evolve. A collection of [[Memes]] forms a [[Culture]].

Think of [[Memes]] as any ideas that are passed between lots of people. For example, a language, scientific theory, or religious belief are all memes. Memes have to be actively replicated to survive (i.e. spoken or written and distributed). A [[Rational Meme]] is a [[Good Explanation]] that relies on the recipient's critical faculties to cause itself to be replicated. An [[Anti-rational Meme]] is a [[Bad Explanation]] and invariably relies on hijacking base emotions for replication ( tapping into fear or anger).

Deustsch defines [[Optimism]] as the theory that all failures are due to lack of [[Knowledge]]. That doesn't mean proceeding as if there won't be bad outcomes (since problems are inevitable) - he calls that [[Blind Optimism]]. In contrast [[Blind Pessimism]] is avoiding everything not known to be safe.

[[Dynamic Societies]] tend towards [[Optimism]] and [[Rational Meme]]s. Because they embody the principles of the [[Enlightenment]] they make rapid progress. [[Static Societies]] fear change, are dominated by [[Anti-rational Meme]]s, and stifle [[Conjecture]] and [[Criticism]].

There are no mathematically provably fair forms of [[Governing]] and therefore the most important aspect to get right is to be able to remove leaders (see [[Criticism]] and [[Error Correction]]) when necessary.

We should not use (the semblance of) [[Sustainability]] as an aspiration or a constraint on planning. For example, we shouldn't just try and solve the 'human' part of global warming. If the earth goes into a new ice-age, or warms dangerously, we should solve that regardless of how much of it is man-made or not.

Humanity was never sustainable. It is a myth that there ever was a time of tranquility where we lived peacefully at one with nature and each other. Just open any history book or talk to any archaeologist. Human life was brutal until very recently. And eventually we will be wiped out by an extinction event (ice age, meteor, supernova, gamma ray burst), unless we choose otherwise and create the [[Knowledge]] to save us.

Since all problems can be solved with the right [[Knowledge]] and we humans, as [[Universal Explainers]], have the potential to obtain any knowledge, we can have a cosmically sized impact upon the universe. Not only can we survive, but we can explore, learn, and thrive throughout our galaxy and more. If we so choose.

achieved a kind of cognitive escape velocity,

[[People]] are [[Universal Constructor]]s.

All observation is theory-laden.

[[Explanation]]s at any level of emergence can be fundamental. Abstract entities are real, and can play a role in causing physical phenomena.

[[Universal Computation]]: anything that can be written down as a program can be computed given the right memory and enough time.

## Why

- Why this book is so important
  - Easy to be nihilistic.
    - Universe is so large
    - Entropy
    - Humanity
  - But humans are [[People]] with infinite [[Reach]]
    - We can achieve anything within the laws of physics
  - The enemy is not technology / progress
- Progress is both possible and desirable
- There is no Shire
- Sustainability without progress is not a thing
- The culture of [[Conjecture]]/[[Criticism]] created during the [[Enlightenment]] puts us on the path to infinity. To control everything within the laws of physics.
- Free speech is the most important right
- Morality is objective
- Universal computation

[[Problems]] are inevitable. All problems can be solved with the right knowledge.

The humanity ending comet is already hurtling towards us. In every given century there is a one in a thousand chance earth would be struck with a comet that kills most of humanity.

Other threats: gamma rays, solar storm, supernova, sun exploding, nuclear weapons, stasis.

If a one-kilometre asteroid had approached the Earth on a collision course at any time in human history before the early twenty-first century, it would have killed at least a substantial proportion of all humans. In that respect, as in many others, we live in an era of unprecedented safety: the twenty-first century is the first ever moment when we have known how to defend ourselves from such impacts, which occur once every 250,000 years or so. This may sound too rare to care about, but it is random. A probability of one in 250,000 of such an impact in any given year means that a typical person on Earth would have a far larger chance of dying of an asteroid impact than in an aeroplane crash. And the next such object to strike us is already out there at this moment, speeding towards us with nothing to stop it except human knowledge.

## Political systems

The most important aspect is error correction, essentially being able to remove bad leaders.

## Knowledge

There are only two known sources of [[Knowledge]] creation. Evolution and our minds.

Memes are similar to genes in the way that they replicate.

- Conjecture
  - Rejection of authority
- Criticism
  - Fabillism (error correction)

Involves rejection of authority.

Good/bad [[Explanation]]:
An explanation that is hard/easy to vary while still accounting for what it purports to account for.

_The Enlightenment_ (The beginning of) a way of pursuing knowledge with a tradition of criticism and seeking good explanations instead of reliance on authority.

## Refuted modes

- Empiricism
- Ampromorphism

_Empiricism_ The misconception that we ‘derive’ all our knowledge from sensory experience.

_Inductivism_ The misconception that scientific theories are obtained by generalizing or extrapolating repeated experiences, and that the more often a theory is confirmed by observation the more likely it becomes.

_Induction_ The non-existent process of ‘obtaining’ referred to above. Principle of induction The idea that ‘the future will resemble the past’, combined with the misconception that this asserts anything about the future.

_Realism_ The idea that the physical world exists in reality, and that knowledge of it can exist too. _Relativism_ The misconception that statements cannot be objectively true or false, but can be judged only relative to some cultural or other arbitrary standard.

_Instrumentalism_ The misconception that science cannot describe reality, only predict outcomes of observations.

_Justificationism_ The misconception that knowledge can be genuine or reliable only if it is justified by some source or criterion.

Reductionism The misconception that science must or should always explain things by analysing them into components (and hence that higher-level explanations cannot be fundamental).

_Rule of thumb_ ‘Purely predictive theory’ (theory whose explanatory content is all background knowledge). Problem A problem exists when a conflict between ideas is experienced.

_Principle of Mediocrity_ - (anti-anthroprocentric)

The idea that there is nothing significant about humans (cosmically speaking) and anything claiming the opposite (e.g. sun revolves around the earth) is wrong. This theory is wrong because humans are knowledge creating [[People]] (thus have infinite potential).

## [[Reach]]

## People

- Universal explainers.
- Could be us, aliens, an AI. We all have this in common.

## Universal systems

## [[Spaceship Earth]]

- Fallacy. Earth was never friendly to us / had our priorities in mind. We would die without technology in oxford.
- Technology is automatic once created

## Spaceship spaceship

- Harvesting up hydrogen atoms to create a space station
