# the discrete image

notes on Bernard Stiegler's [The Discrete Image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echographies_of_Television), about the invention of digital photography and cinema.

> life is always already cinema.

⠀ 

[stiegler](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Stiegler) agrees with [derrida](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida)'s critique of the opposition of the signifier and the signified, which proposes that language is always already writing, and *in order for language to be written, it must already be a writing, a system of traces, a grammatic of discrete elements.*


image mental ∄ → image mental ≔ image object
- ∄ image-object sans image mental,
- ∄ image-mental sans image object.
- image-object lasts, image-mental ephemeral.
- ∄ image → ∄ imagination sans memoire ∴ question de l'image porte sur traces et inscriptions, ≈ écriture.


#### discretization
- [barthes](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Barthes) proposes that photography is *ēpokhē* to time, memory and death.
- **manipulation is the rule of the digital photo**, contrary to the essence
- one cannot confirm if what I see in a digital photo exists or not ∴ analogico-digital breaks with [bazin](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/André_Bazin)'s *objectivité de l'objectif*, l'intentionalité (phenomenology)
- distinguish true and falls is harder, exploited and generalized w/mass media, dangerous panic decomposing social bond.
- digital technology allows us to manipulate and transform information unlike analog technology.
- infinitively manipulable but still a photo, it keeps something from the this was.
	- ~~This was not~~ → *This was* but there is *something* that *isn't quite right.* this is because analog photo is a technical synthesis.


#### 3 main types of reproducibility have constituted and overdetermined great epochs of memory and the relations to time in the west. (letter, analog, digital)
- reproducibility of the letter (written → printed)
- analog reproducibility (cine, photo → [walter benjamin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin))
- digital reproducibility
- analogico-digital image combines 2 reproducibilities (digital, analog) ∴ shows they are not opposed and need to be overcome.
- the analog image is ∴ always discrete since its reality effects are determined by the photographic (framing, dof) and literal context in which it is inserted. seems continuous but is discrete.


director/editor's job is to hide the discontinuity by playing with it (analysis), continuity then comes from spectatorial synthesis (done by good artists)
- animated image ≔ plurality of discontinuous images sequentially connected
- spectatorial synthesis: the *belief* that *this was* is. made by audience (retinal) persistance and expectations of sequential connections
- discontinuity dissolves all the more effectively the more cleverly it is orchestrated
- production/realization.


discretization opens new artistic, theoretical and scientific knowledges of the image.
- digitization allows the *this was* to be decomposed analytically by discretizatizing the continuous.
- barthes's photographic reality effect has now been integrated into all techniques of digital treatment simulation.
- **spectator's relation to the image is ∴ an analytic relation as well.**
	- ⤷ the question is the relation between synthesis and analysis.


#### 3 kinds of images (analog, digital, analogico-digital) → 3 kinds of intuitive technical knowledges (conditions of image production) → 3 different kinds of belief.
- the visual image is synthetic in 2 ways: synthesis as belief, the this was effect, is a combination of 2 syntheses (spectator and camera). spectator is affected in the way he synthesizes the image.
	- This requires an image-object ∴ technology.
	- synthesis from the subject comes from its knowledge of the technical conditions of an image-object's production.
- each image, either analog or digital, contains both knowledge and gaps in knowledge. This new awareness leads to a different form of understanding and knowledge.
	- analogico-digital technology of images opens an epoch of analytic apprehension of the image-object.
        - since synthesis is double, new analytic capacities → new synthetic capacities.
        - this discretization breaks up a continuity ∴ changes the way the observer's viewing. (discretization concernant regard est transformé)


**since greece we live in an era of the relation to language, shaped by the ::generalization of alphabetic writing that gave rise to logic, philosophy and science.:: the analogico-digital is of the same order.**
- the adoption of alphabetic writing made analysis and synthesis of language much easier. **generalization → discretization.**
- relation to the analog image is going to be very discretized as digitazion techniques of animated images become widespread. this will open a critical access to the image and a chance to develop a **culture of reception.**

now there's two syntheses (spectator + camera): evolution of technical synthesis → evolution of spectatorial synthesis.
- new image-objects will create new mental images and another intelligence of movement (not knowledge of the image but a new techno-intuitive knowledge). this will be influenced by other knowledges which opens up "la chance"
- technology gives us the chance to look at cinema in a different way. analysis (production) and synthesis (consumption) are more connected, making cinema similar to literature. fft
	- alphabetic writing reveals the discrete characters of language fft
	- reading and writing (can't do one without the other)
	- implies the rethink of hollywood's schema of analysis/production - synthesis/consumption.
- technology will make it possible to watch a movie analytically, making text and tv closer than now.
	- we will be able to navigate though the flow of images in a nonlinear way, with toc and indexes (like books), true hypermedia?


⠀ 

- technological synthesis is not a replica nor double, like writing is not a replication of speech.
- life (anima, mental image) is always already cinema (animation, image object).
