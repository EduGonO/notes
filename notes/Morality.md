Morality is objective 
type of knowledge

      

Moral philosophy is basically about the problem of what to do next–and, more generally, what sort of life to lead, and what sort of world to want.

Moral truths are objective. They can be discovered by the usual methods of reason, which are essentially the same as those of science (although there are important differences).

Science and morality are based on reason. So if you adopt a rational attitude toward morality, and therefore say that morality consists of moral knowledge—and knowledge always consists of conjectures, doesn't need a basis, only needs modes of criticism; and those modes of criticism operate by criteria that are themselves subject to modes of criticism—then you come to a transcendent moral truth. If all knowledge is conjectural and subject to improvement, then protecting the means of improving knowledge is more important than any particular piece of knowledge.
