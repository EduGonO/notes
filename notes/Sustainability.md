# Sustainability

The term has two almost opposite, but often confused, meanings: to provide someone with what they need, and to prevent things from changing.

Homo-sapiens was never sustainable. No species is - 99% of them have gone extinct. Eventually the human-race will be, unless we choose otherwise, wiped out by some ice age, a meteor, a supernova, etc. 

The idea that we can harken back to some prehistoric time where life was sustainable and we all lived in tranquility like hobbits isnâ€™t grounded in reality. Only [[Knowledge]] can save us. Only [[Progress]] is sustainable.
