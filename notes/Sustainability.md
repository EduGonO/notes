The term has two almost opposite, but often confused, meanings: to provide someone with what they need, and to prevent things from changing.

Humanity was never sustainable. Eventually we would have been wiped out by some ice age, a meteor, a supernova, etc. The idea that we can harken back to some prehistoric time where life was sustainable and we all lived in tranquility like hobbits isnâ€™t grounded in reality. Only knowledge can save us.


Only progress is sustainable.
