      

Darwin’s theory of evolution (survival of the fittest isn’t exactly accurate). It’s actually about propagation of genes. There are scenarios where living things can evolve in a way that suits propogation of their genes but is detrimental to the species.

      

Dawkins named his tour-de-force account of neo-Darwinism The Selfish Gene because he wanted to stress that evolution does not especially promote the ‘welfare’ of species or individual organisms. But, as he also explained, it does not promote the ‘welfare’ of genes either: it adapts them not for survival in larger numbers, nor indeed for survival at all, but only for spreading through the population at the expense of rival genes, particularly slight variants of themselves. Organisms are the slaves, or tools, that genes use to achieve their ‘purpose’ of spreading themselves through the population.
