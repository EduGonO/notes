# Principle of Mediocrity      

The misconception that there is nothing significant about humans (cosmically speaking) and anything claiming the opposite (e.g. sun revolves around the earth) is wrong. 

While this philosophy has been a useful rule of thumb to refute [[Anthropocentric]] explanations of the universe it is ultimately wrong because humans are [[Knowledge]] creating [[People]] (thus have infinite potential).
