# Criticism
The growth of [[Knowledge]] consists of correcting misconceptions in our theories. Ever since the [[Enlightenment]] this had happened through a tradition of criticism. New explanations are proposed, criticized, and then refined.

Since the tradition of [[Conjecture]] and criticism has created all [[Knowledge]] and [[Progress]] it's absolutely imperative that we keep it. Free speech is critical. No idea should be beyond criticism.
