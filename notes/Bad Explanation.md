# Bad Explanation

A bad explanation is one where where you can change any or all of the details without destroying it.

 For example you could change any of the details of the Ancient Greek's (bad) explanation for seasons via the myth of Persephone's visits to the underworld. For example swapping out the gods, or the timing, or the number of pomegranate seeds.
