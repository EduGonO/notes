# Bad Explanation

A bad explanation is unspecific. You can change any or all of the details without destroying it.

Examples of bad explanations:

- "God did it"
- Biblical creationism 
- The Ancient Greeks myth of [Persephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone)'s movements causing seasons

In the above examples you could change any of the variables and the explantation would make sense.

- "The spaghetti monster did it"
- The earth was created in eight days rather than seven
- Persephone consumed seven seeds rather than six
