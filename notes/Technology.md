# Technology
Everything humans have created is a form of technology. This ranges from laptops, to shirts, to windows.

Once technology is created the use of it can be automated. For example, you don't have to think about your shirt every morning for it to keep you warm. 

This automation extends all the way to extremely complex technologies like keeping the vacuum out of space-stations. Set it and forget it.
