Science is the practice of finding good [[Explanation]]s. Indeed every study is.

The same is true of science. Science is a way of dealing with theories regardless of whether or not one believes them. One judges them according to whether or not they’re good explanations. And if a particular explanation ends up being the only explanation that survives the intense criticism that reason and science can apply, whether or not that includes experimental testing, then it’s not so much adopted at that point as just not discarded. It has survived for the moment.

Once you think of knowledge that way, you realize that, for example, the pattern of base pairs in a gene’s DNA also constitutes knowledge,

The widespread notion is that science reduces to what is testable, and that any claim you can’t measure is somehow vacuous. So, too, is the belief that there exists a bright line between science and every other discipline where we purport to describe reality.
